I am a graduate student pursuing an MS in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst. Previously, I've interned at the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay</a>, working under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/">Ganesh Ramakrishnan</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatapathy-subramanian/">Venkatapathy Subramanian</a>. During my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/en">K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE)</a>, I worked as a Research Assistant for Prof. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninadmehendale/">Ninad Mehendale</a>. Additionally, I collaborated with Prof. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-deepak-sharma/">Deepak Sharma</a> (Vice Principal of KJSCE) on two research projects.

My research interests primarily revolve around Computer Vision, with a specific focus on the application of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and medical diagnosis. I am also intrigued by the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision in fields such as Medical Image Report Generation and Document Image Translation.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball.

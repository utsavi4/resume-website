I'm all about using tech to make the world a better place, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning. I have dedicated myself to exploring how technology can enhance healthcare and improve lives. My ultimate goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that address real-world challenges and make a meaningful impact. Outside of all the serious stuff, I'm a huge music buff and a basketball fanatic. In summary, I am driven by a desire to innovate, contribute to societal well-being, and continuously learn and grow.

My research interests primarily revolve around Computer Vision, with a specific focus on the application of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and medical diagnosis. I am also intrigued by the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision in fields such as Medical Image Report Generation and Document Image Translation.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball.

title: Face Recognition and Detection of students for Attendance
summary: "In an effort to delve into the realm of computer vision and facial recognition, I embarked on a project leveraging OpenCV for 3D model extraction, face detection, and recognition. This involved the meticulous implementation of OpenCV's functionalities to extract detailed 3D models from images, enabling a deeper understanding of spatial structures. Furthermore, I employed sophisticated techniques for face detection and recognition, integrating both Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Haar classifiers. Through extensive training on diverse datasets comprising positive and negative images, I fine-tuned these classifiers to achieve precise and accurate image classification."

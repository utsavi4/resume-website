title: CollegeBloc
summary: "I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application, showcasing my proficiency across the full stack of web development technologies. Furthermore, I integrated cutting-edge blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts into the system, elevating the security and transparency of certificate management and access control mechanisms. This integration not only ensured the immutability of records but also provided enhanced authentication and authorization features. Additionally, I leveraged the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to implement decentralized identity solutions and facilitate secure document storage and retrieval processes. By embracing emerging technologies like blockchain and IPFS, I aimed to create robust, scalable, and decentralized systems that prioritize data integrity and privacy while offering seamless user experiences."

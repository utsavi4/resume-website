title: Music Genre Classification
summary: "In a bid to harness the power of neural networks in the realm of audio processing, I undertook the development of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using Keras. This endeavor involved meticulous feature extraction from the GTZAN dataset, where I meticulously transformed audio files into Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), a critical step in deciphering audio patterns. Leveraging the capabilities of Keras, I integrated softmax activation for multi-class classification, enabling the model to accurately classify audio samples across various categories. Additionally, through the process of fine-tuning, I meticulously honed the model's parameters to optimize performance, ensuring robustness and efficacy in handling diverse audio-related tasks."

title: Smart Vision Glasses
summary: "One of my key accomplishments was implementing optical character recognition (OCR) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities, enabling the conversion of text from images into spoken words, thus aiding accessibility for visually impaired individuals. Additionally, I successfully implemented an EfficientDet-Lite4 model tailored for Indian currency recognition, harnessing the potential of machine learning to accurately identify and classify currency notes. Furthermore, I integrated object detection capabilities using the SSD MobileNet V2 architecture coupled with depth mapping techniques to detect potentially hazardous objects in real-time, thereby enhancing safety measures and alert systems."

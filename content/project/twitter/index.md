title: Detection of Toxic and Fake Tweets on Twitter
summary: "In a quest to unravel the complexities of social media discourse, I embarked on an in-depth tweet analysis journey, employing BeautifulSoup to extract valuable insights from the vast ocean of tweets. Delving deeper, I harnessed the power of artificial intelligence, implementing an LSTM-based model tailored for detecting fake tweets and a CNN-based model adept at identifying toxic content. These models served as robust tools in combating misinformation and fostering a healthier online environment. Furthermore, to democratize access to this analysis, I developed a user-friendly Chrome Extension dedicated to fake tweet detection analysis. This extension empowered users to scrutinize tweets with ease, promoting critical thinking and digital literacy in the age of information overload."

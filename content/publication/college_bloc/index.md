abstract: "A student, whether in high school, pursuing undergraduate, or postgraduate studies, generates numerous certificates like results, diplomas, and transcripts throughout their educational journey. These certificates are vital for admissions into educational institutions or employment in companies. However, manually tracking and verifying the authenticity of these certificates can be a cumbersome task. Without a reliable anti-forgery system in place, there is a risk of encountering counterfeit graduation certificates. To enhance the security and integrity of this data, there is a need for digitization guided by the principles of Confidentiality, Reliability, and Availability. This objective can be effectively achieved through the application of blockchain technology. In a nutshell, our system's workflow will involve a Certificate Issuer responsible for creating certificates. Before these certificates are issued to students, they will undergo validation by a panel within the issuing organization. Each certificate will be associated with a unique hash key, which serves as a means for any organization to easily verify the certificate's authenticity through a dedicated portal. The advantages of such a system are manifold. Students face reduced risks of losing or damaging their certificates, and the process of verifying these certificates becomes significantly streamlined for organizations. "

abstract: "The increasing difficulty for farmers to keep up with the production of food crops to meet the demands of the huge population of our country is a cause for concern. The methods used by farmers are not only old and , but also unyielding Inefficient farming techniques lead to added cost, wastage of land, financial losses due to crop failure. Here comes the need for smart farming which is the use of technologies like IoT devices and cloud networks to increase efficiency and productivity of the farming techniques along with monitoring the growth and state of the crop by the weather, temperature, humidity etc with the help of sensors and maintaining the parameters at optimum levels. Apart from the farming techniques, market price management for farmers in rural areas leads to adverse conditions financially. The need for awareness about the market prices keeping in mind the current conditions using is imminent. Using Machine Learning techniques to predict prices for every crop so that the farmer can plan it accordingly. The paper mentions different methods used under smart farming, issues faced by farmers, and use of IoT and cloud services to enhance the efficiency of yields."

abstract: "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the annual global costs of productivity losses associated with vision impairment are approximately $411 billion, demonstrating the significant economic impact of this condition. In addition, WHO reports that at least 2.2 billion people worldwide have some form of vision impairment, with approximately 1 billion of these cases being preventable or treatable. These individuals face significant challenges in their daily lives, including difficulty with tasks such as walking and reading. To address these challenges, the goal of this research is to design a set of smart glasses for the blind and visually impaired that can assist with these daily activities. The glasses include three main modules: object detection, reading, and currency recognition. The object detection and navigation module use object detection models like Faster R-CNN and SSD MobileNet in combination with Google Maps API to identify and locate objects in the environment, allowing users to navigate more easily and avoid obstacles. The reading module uses Google Cloud Vision OCR to recognize and interpret text, enabling users to access written information that would otherwise be unavailable to them. The currency recognition module uses an EfficientDet-Lite4 model to detect and classify Indian banknotes, allowing users to make financial transactions with greater ease. All these modules are integrated into a mobile application and run on a wearable device equipped with an ESP32 Camera. There is also potential for further development of the technology to assist with a wider range of tasks. Overall, this research represents an important step towards improving the lives of individuals with vision impairments. "
